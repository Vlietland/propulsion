This is a sample project demonstrating how to use Playwright for end-to-end testing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playwright-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd playwright-example
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

## Configuration

The Playwright configuration can be found in `playwright.config.ts`. You can customize the test directory, timeout settings, and other configurations as needed.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npx playwright test
```

## Writing Tests

Tests are located in the `tests` directory. You can create new test files following the structure of `example.spec.ts`. Each test file should export a test suite containing one or more test cases.

## Example Test

An example test case is provided in `tests/example.spec.ts`, which navigates to a specified URL and performs assertions on the page elements.
